What does a high achiever's mindset look like? I call it "AOS," Achiever's Operating System. Just like your computer, your phone, and your tablet have software that need to be upgraded regularly, so does the software and thinking inside your head. 

The question is: what does a high achiever's mindset look like? How do they think? 

High achievers believe in themselves. They see themselves as successful and as high achievers. 

They believe that they can do great things. They believe that they're capable, that they have potential. If they don't have the resources today, they will go and find them, or they will create them. Even if they don't have the skills or knowledge, then they will go and learn them. 

They believe that they deserve success; not that they're entitled to it, but they believe that, if they pay the price, then they deserve the success that comes with it. They never think in terms of can't, e.g. "I can't do that." No way! They've eliminated the 'ugliest four-letter word' from their vocabularies. 

They also have what I call "OCH," Obsessive Compulsive Hunger. Let me emphasize "hunger." As I've studied high achievers, they all have ambition. 

High achievers have a desire and a drive for achievement. The "status quo" for a high achiever is not acceptable. 

They believe that if someone else can do something, then they can do it, too. Ultimately, they believe they can do anything that they put their minds to. 

They take responsibility for their wins and their losses. They never take on a "blame and victimize" mentality. They take responsibility for their lives. 

When they have setbacks and failures along the way they bounce back quickly. They are resilient. 

These are the qualities and mindsets of high achievers. How do you stack up? Where can you improve? I encourage you to adopt a high achiever's mindset, and, if you do, you will find that you'll achieve more of your goals and your dreams.
