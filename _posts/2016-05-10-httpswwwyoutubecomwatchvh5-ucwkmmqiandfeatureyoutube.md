I love speaking and inspiring audiences to reach toward GREATNESS, but being "introduced" is often interesting and uncertain. I was once introduced before a speech to 4,000 people in Malaysia as George Clooney's younger brother. The emcee was having fun, and as I came on stage, the audience was standing and clapping. Some were whistling, and others were yelling in a spirit of excitement. As I was walking on stage, I couldn't help but think, "I wonder if some in this audience actually think I am George Clooney's brother :-)" 

Sometimes introductions are too long -- way too long. If you want to put an audience asleep, read the full-page bio of the speaker. On the other hand, I think the best introductions are those that get to the point, create excitement, and keep it engaging, fun, and inspirational. 

[Click here:][0] We recently discovered a recording of a motivational speech I gave a couple of years ago and I wanted to share it with you! I was speaking in Los Angeles to 300 people, and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction. It was awesome! The speech was a success and a lot of fun! [Listen to the 'introduction' here ][0]

FYI: When asked how I want to be introduced, I typically suggest something like: "Tell the audience that I strive to be a great husband, father, servant leader, and, by the way, you might want to mention that I'm also a bestselling author." Sometimes that works, but people typically want more. However, I have found that being positive and concise is good. From experience, I believe an audience will get to know me and connect with me best as I pour my heart into them. "Less is more!" 

Here is an endorsement I received last week. Thank you, Nigel! "I have had the distinct pleasure of experiencing TJ Hoisington present to various corporate and association groups on several occasions in the past two years. He is without any doubt one of the most dynamic and exciting speakers I have ever experienced (and I have seen many all over the world). His message is always timely, full of very practical advice and down to earth as well as being tailored specifically to his audience. He always gets rave reviews! I have also purchased all of his books and have bought additional copies to give to business contacts who have always enjoyed them immensely. TJ can be relied upon to substantially enhance any corporate event or meeting."
